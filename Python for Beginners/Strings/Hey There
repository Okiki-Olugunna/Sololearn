#Youâ€™re given a task to write the word "hi" 42 times. Boring, right?

# Write a program to do it for you.

# Create a program to output "hi" 42 times, without any separators, on the same line.



print("hi" * 42)


# alternative 

for i in range(1, 43):
    print("hi")



# or

i = 1
while i <= 42:
    print("hi")
    i += 1
