#Ever wondered how many seconds there are in a month (30 days)?

# Write a program to calculate and output the answer.
# Remember, there are 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, 
# and 60 seconds in a minute.
# Use the print() statement to output the result.


in_an_hour = 60 * 60

in_a_day = in_an_hour * 24

in_a_month = in_a_day * 30


print(in_a_month)
