#Random task! You need to calculate the number of hours in 888 minutes.

# Your program needs to output the number of hours and then the number of remaining minutes, on separate lines.

# For example, 72 minutes are equal to 1 hour and 12 minutes, so your program would output:
# 1
# 12


print(888 // 60)
print(888 % 60)
