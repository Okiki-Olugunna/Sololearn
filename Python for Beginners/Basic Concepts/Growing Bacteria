# Did you know that there are more bacteria cells in 
# your body than cells that make up your body? Weird!

# A bacteria culture starts with 500 bacteria and doubles in size every hour.
# Which means that after 1 hour the number of bacteria is 1000, 
# after 2 hours, 2000, and so on.

# Calculate and output the number of bacteria that will be in the culture after 24 hours.



bacteria = 500

one_hour = bacteria * (2**1)

two_hours = one_hour * (2**2)


print(bacteria*(2**24))
